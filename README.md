# Summary
This application was created specifically for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. App enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

# Technologies Used
Stack View,
Auto Layout,
UIKit,
Swift,
Text Field Delegate

# User Interface
MeMe has four main view controllers :
MemeEditorViewController: This controller allows user to edit memes.The Meme Editor view has a toolbar with two buttons: one that allows user to open the Photo Album to select an image, one that launches the camera. After editing the meme, user can either save it or share it. The user can aslo cancel the editing by clicking the cancel button.

MemeTableViewController: The saved memes are presented in this controller as a table view

MemeCollectionViewController: : The saved memes are presented in this controller as a collection view

MemeDetailViewController: Upon selection, this controller displays the an appropriately sized and scaled meme

# Conclusion
In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered UIKit and set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app, build tables with datasources and delegates, create custom table view cells, implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views.
